This file lists a week-by-week breakdown of my learning adventure during my Bioinformatics internship at University of California Riverside (UCR) in 2012.

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 1: Introduction to Linux and R
- Got introduced to Linux and R environments. 
- Read through the Linux and R Basics manual.
- Practiced R programming and solved problems.

### Week 2: RNA-Seq Data Analysis Workflow
- Learned about the workflow of RNA-Seq data analysis.
- Explored different aspects of NG sequencing, from using Biostrings to understanding short reads.
- Got introduced to Bowtie and started working on an RNA-seq project.

### Week 3: Script Writing and Alignment with Bowtie
- Started and completed writing a demultiplexing script.
- Conducted alignment with Bowtie for the RNA-seq project.
- Explored Bioconductor IRanges and Genomic Ranges.

### Week 4: Counting, Annotation and Differential Expression Analysis
- Worked on counting, rpkm and annotation for the RNA-seq project.
- Read and implemented Bioconductor DESeq and EdgeR for differential expression analysis.

### Week 5: GFF import and Understanding BAM File Structure
